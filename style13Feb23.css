/* POSITIONS-The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky). */
/* RELATIVE */
/* An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. */
